/**
 * Rx observer implementation that delegates calls {@link Observer#onNext(Object)}, {@link Observer#onError(Throwable)},
 * {@link Observer#onCompleted()} to specified actions. The purpose of this class is to avoid memory leaks in such way that anonymous
 * action implementations, shouldn't keep implicit reference to the outer object but have access to it as parameter. This class keeps
 * weak reference to the target object and provides it as a parameter during delegation calls. Delegated actions will be invoked only in
 * case if there is reference to target object.
 *
 * @param <TARGET>   class of target weak referenced object that will be passed to actions as a parameter
 * @param <RESPONSE> class that will be emitted by observable
